# Puzzles: How old are the kids?

The other day I overheard a conversation between two people in a park, I'll call them Alice and Bob.

- Alice: So, do you have any children?
- Bob: Yes, 3.
- Alice: Really, how old are they?
- Bob: Well, the product of their ages is 36.
- Alice: Oh god, not this again Bob!...  OK, product means if you multiply them all together, right? 
- (Bob nods)
- Alice: OK... Er... I'm gonna need another clue.
- Bob: The sum of their ages is the number on that building over there.
- Alice: The bakery?
- Bob: Yeah, that's the one.
- Alice: OK... that narrows it down, but can I have one more clue?
- Bob: Sure... the eldest plays drums.
- Alice: Huh?... Oh... Got it!

Though I didn't see the number on the bakery I was able to figure out the children's ages... can you?
