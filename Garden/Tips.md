# Gardening Tips

Tomatoes: Hairs on stem are potential roots; roots give more tomatoes; so cut off lower leaves and get the stems in the soil.
Tomatoes: Feed them asprin to kill off pests
Tomatoes: Ensure theres water for birds to stop birds from eating the fruit

# Projects

## Raised beds

- Make structure by bolting wood together
- Add bamboo supports to help hold things
- Dangle strings for plants to grow up
- Put knots in string for anchor points
- Tie rings of string above the knots and loop loosely around the stems to provide support / room for growth
- Consider the base: 
  - open to the soil for worm acccess?
  - add gravel / rocks for lower drainage?
  - add tapping off point in case flooded?
  - Add organic material to encourage worms into the base?

## Compost

- Create a turner using the old bike, so we can peddle to mix it up

## Wormery

- Gem's project; she's the expert

## Pond

- Gem wants an old bath... look for fun ways to combine it with a pond, e.g. plumb in taps to top it up from pond (add filters)
- Dig it with a large shallow area / some shallow islands so birds feel safe & can splash
- Put in plants / work out which need to be above water and which under
- big ground sheet to stop it from draining into the soil
- keep nutrients low to avoid unwanted growths / ensure just enough for the plants we put there
- maybe the bike compost idea above could be bike to pump water from pond to the bath?
